# Machine-Learning-for-Finance
As part of an assignment in the "DSA 5045: Machine Learning for Finance" course, I have performed portfolio optimization techiques to determine the strategic optimal asset allocation for the Investment Corporation of Dubai. 

I have added comments to the Python code that will make it easier to understand for anyone who is trying out on similar tasks.
